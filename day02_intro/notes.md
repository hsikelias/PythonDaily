print () # this is a function

print (Hello World) # here python doesnt identify Hello World as string, we need "" to very it
answer : print ("Hello World")

## Identations
- Unlike in many other programs, python prioritizes Identations a lot.

      ex: if 5 > 2:
          print("Five is greater than two!")
; this gives a syntax error
        correct form : if 5 > 2:
                            print("Five is greater than two!")

## Comments

-We often want to write notes in our code to remind overselves about something. In that case we use #
-What if theres a huge comment??
 you use either """ or ''' orr you can just use # at lines where u want it to be a comment.


 ## Escape Sequence Character

 - Used to insert characters that are illegal in a string.
       - \n = new line : basically prints in the new line
       - \t = tab : 
       - \\ = backlash
       - \" = double quote
       - \' = single quote
