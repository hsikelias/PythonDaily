## Python Variables

 - Variables are like containers, they hold data.
  ex : 
        a = 1
        b = "real"
        c = True

 - You dont need to specify the type of a variable unless you want to change the type like 1 which is an int at default can be changed to string. This is called **Casting**  

 - use type() function to get the data type of a variable

 - You can assign values to multiple variables in one line
   
    x,y,z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
        print(x)
        print(y)
        print(z)

- One value to Multiple Variables 
 x = y = z = "Orange"
        print(x)
        print(y)
        print(z)

## Unpacking a Collection : 

- Imagine you have a collection of values in a list or tuple and you wont to send the values into a variable.

list1 = ["book","chair","diamond"]
x, y, z = list1
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


- Use { } to make a list and use [] for lists(when trying to access a character from the list)



# DAILY REMARKS : 
- need more list practices, practice more with escape statements, f-strings
