## Python Variables

 - Variables are like containers, they hold data.
  ex : 
        a = 1
        b = "real"
        c = True

 - You dont need to specify the type of a variable unless you want to change the type like 1 which is an int at default can be changed to string. This is called **Casting**  

 - use type() function to get the data type of a variable

 - You can assign values to multiple variables in one line
   
   ''' x,y,z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
   print(x)
   print(y)
   print(z)
   '''
